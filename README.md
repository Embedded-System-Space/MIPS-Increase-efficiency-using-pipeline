# MIPS-Increase-efficiency-using-pipelines
This repo consists of 3 codes. The first code is small but not very efficient for the processor, the second code is the same but with a description about the CPI ( Clock Per Instruction ) and other calculations that are relative to the program efficiency, lastly, the third code is a reformat of the first code to help MIPS execute the same instructions but more efficiently using pipeline technology
