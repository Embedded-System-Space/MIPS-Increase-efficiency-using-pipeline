# Introduction 
This repo consists of 3 codes. The first code is small but not very efficient for the processor. The second code is the same but with a description about the CPI ( Clock Per Instruction ) and other calculations that are relative to the program's efficiency. Lastly, the third code is a reformat of the first code to help MIPS execute the same instructions but more efficiently using pipeline technology. 

# pipeline
In both cases of the first and third program the simulation is using the pipeline technology as default. However in the case of the third program we use the pipeline in such way that we are allowing the processor to execute the set of the instructions in our code efficiently, it takes less time to execute the whole program, or in an other way we decreace the CPI and also we decrease the program's run time.

# Simulator
