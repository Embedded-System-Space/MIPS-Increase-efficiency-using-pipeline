# Introduction 
This repo consists of 3 codes. The first code is small but not very efficient for the processor. The second code is the same but with a description about the CPI ( Clock Per Instruction ) and other calculations that are relative to the program's efficiency. Lastly, the third code is a reformat of the first code to help MIPS execute the same instructions but more efficiently using pipeline technology.

# Simulator
- [x] WinMips64
